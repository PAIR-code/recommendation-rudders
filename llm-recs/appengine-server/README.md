# Setup

1. This application is for running in AppEngine in a Google Cloud Project. You
   can create one at https://console.cloud.google.com/ This runs on needs to
   have billing enabled, which you can do at:
   https://console.cloud.google.com/billing

1. All further commands assume you have installed gcloud command, and set your
   project:

```sh
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
```

1. You will need to setup an API key that has access to the sheets API, and from
   the domain that this applications runs from. For local development
   add `localhost` too.

1. You will need to setup some OAuth2 credentials for users to be able to login
   to the app so they can save/load data from google sheets. You can do this in
   the UI at: https://pantheon.corp.google.com/apis/credentials

   * You will need the OAuth scopes to include:
     `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`

   * To do local development, you need to specify that http://localhost is listed in the "Authorised JavaScript origins". Once you have done this, you will need to copy the ClientID from the WebUI into a copy of
   `llm-recs-webclient/src/environments/gcloud_env.template.ts` named
   `llm-recs-webclient/src/environments/gcloud_env.ts`. Also copy the API Key from the previous into here too.

1. Enable the Vertex AI Platform APIs and Sheets APIs. You can do this with the
   command:

```sh
gcloud services enable sheets.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable drive.googleapis.com
```

1. You need to create, or have an existing AppEngine setup for your cloud
   project too. It can be enabled in the web UI at
   https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/start/create This will happen when
   you first deploy also, but it has to be setup before you can give permissions
   in the next step.

1. The AppEngine service account needs to have permission to make prediction
   requests. You can give this permission using:

```sh
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
    ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --member=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}@appspot.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role=serviceAccount:roles/aiplatform.user
```

1. The following create a service account key locally [not cuyrrently used]

```sh
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create .config/key.json \
  --iam-account=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Note: this gives a little more than just the strict prediction ability. You can
make a custom role if you want it to be more constrained. But in practice,
something like this will be convenient for extending to add other kinds of AI
Platform features.

This application uses the App Engine standard environment in nodejs. More about that is at: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/runtime

## CURL tickling of the server to get an embedding

```sh
curl \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://localhost:8080/api/embed \
-d $'{ "text": "I love flowers" }'
```

## Running and developing locally

You need to have setup application-default credentials (a cache of your credentials on your machine for the local server to be able to access google cloud APIs). You can do this with the command:

```sh
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Once that has been done, you can just run the following to start a local server that should act very similarly to how it would on cloud:

```sh
npm run start
```

### Trouble shooting & common Errors

* API permissions errors: the main sources of differences running locally vs
  cloud deployed behaviour is that, in a cloud deployment, the service will run
  as the appengine-service-worker, but locally it will run as the
  `application-default` credentials (`application-default` credentials act as
  the permissions that your logged in account has); these may have different access permissions.

* `Error: Unable to detect a Project Id in the current environment.`: Make sure
  you have set the cloud project (command `gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}`), and that you have created default credentials (command `$ gcloud auth application-default login`).


## Automated Tests

```sh
npm run test
```

## Building

```sh
npm run build-static
```

## Deploying

Deploy to production appengine environment. Remember to first set your cloud
project so you don't deploy to the wrong one. e.g.

```sh
gcloud config set project ${YOUR_CLOUD_PROJECT}
```

And then you can deploy using:

```sh
gcloud app deploy app.yaml
```

Note: files specified in `.gcloudignore` are ignored, and not uploaded.

You can then view the live site online with:

```sh
gcloud app browse
```

### Seeing the logs of the deployed version in AppEngine

See the `default` service's recorded logs (via appengine):

```sh
gcloud app logs tail -s default
```

Note: this can be a bit slow to start.

To see AppEngine's system logs in web UI go to:
https://console.developers.google.com/appengine/services
And look at the service entry for this application (by default it is the
"default" service) and click on logs button at the far right to see this
service's logs.
